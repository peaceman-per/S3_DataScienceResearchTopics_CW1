# Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable natural language generation capabilities but exhibit a persistent tendency to produce factually inaccurate or unsupported outputs—a phenomenon termed "hallucination." This review addresses: *How do large language models balance factual accuracy and creative generation, and what methodological approaches have been proposed to mitigate hallucination in Generative AI systems?*

The review synthesises recent research examining hallucination taxonomies, causal mechanisms, and intervention strategies. Definitional frameworks distinguish intrinsic hallucinations (contradicting provided context) from extrinsic hallucinations (unsupported by training data), and separate hallucination (consistency with model-accessible sources) from factuality (correspondence with external truth). Proposed causal mechanisms include overconfidence from hard-label supervision, knowledge overshadowing wherein dominant representations suppress less prominent information, and systemic factors spanning data collection, architecture, pretraining, fine-tuning, and inference.

Mitigation strategies span retrieval-augmented generation, reasoning-based methods such as Chain-of-Thought, knowledge distillation, and contrastive decoding. Evaluation methodologies have evolved beyond surface overlap metrics toward entailment-based classifiers, uncertainty quantification, and dynamic benchmark generation. The emerging consensus indicates hybrid approaches show greatest promise given hallucination's multi-causal nature.

Critically, the field recognises second-order trade-offs: excessive faithfulness optimisation reduces informational coverage, truthfulness interventions can degrade safety-aligned refusal behaviours, and precision-recall tensions emerge between helpfulness and hallucination risk. These findings shift focus from eliminating hallucination to managing it within multi-objective alignment frameworks. Research gaps persist in benchmark coverage, philosophical grounding of the creativity-hallucination boundary, and computational overhead analysis. As LLMs become increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains, achieving principled balance between factual accuracy and creative generation remains central to generative AI research.
